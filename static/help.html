To find where setResourceMonitors is defined:
<a href="search?q=&amp;defs=setResourceMonitors">defs=setResourceMonitors</a>

To find files that use sprintf in usr/src/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/:
<a href="search?refs=sprintf&amp;path=usr%2Fsrc%2Fcmd%2Fcmd-inet%2Fusr.sbin%2F"
>refs=sprintf&path:usr/src/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin</a>

To find assignments to variable foo:
<a href="search?q=%22foo+%3D%22">"foo ="</a>

To find Makefiles where pstack binary is being built:
<a href="search?q=pstack&amp;path=Makefile">pstack&path=Makefile</a>

to search for phrase "Bill Joy":
<a href="search?q=%22Bill+Joy%22">"Bill Joy"</a>

To find perl files that do not use /usr/bin/perl but something else:
<a href="search?q=-%22%2Fusr%2Fbin%2Fperl%22+%2B%22%2Fbin%2Fperl%22"
>-"/usr/bin/perl" +"/bin/perl"</a>

To find all strings beginning with foo use the wildcard:
<a href="search?q=foo*">foo*</a>

To find all files which have . c in their name (dot is a token!):
<a href="search?path=%22. c%22">". c"</a>

To find all files which start with "ma" and then have only alphabet characters do:
<a href="search?path=/ma[a-zA-Z]*/">path=/ma[a-zA-Z]*/</a>

To find all main methods in all files analyzed by C analyzer (so .c, .h, ...) do:
<a href="search?q=main&type=c">main&type:c</a>

            A
            <dfn>Query</dfn> is a series of clauses. A clause may be prefixed by:
            <ul>
                <li>a plus "
                    <b>+</b>" or a minus "
                    <b>-</b>" sign, indicating that the clause is required or prohibited respectively; or</li>
                <li>a
                    <dfn>term</dfn> followed by a colon "
                    <b>:</b>", indicating the
                    <dfn>field</dfn> to be searched. This enables one to construct queries which search multiple
                    <dfn>fields</dfn>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A
                <dfn>clause</dfn> may be either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a
                    <dfn>term</dfn>, indicating all the documents that contain this term; or
                </li>
                <li>a
                    <dfn>phrase</dfn> - group of words surrounded by double quotes
                    <b>" "</b>, e.g. "hello dolly" </li>
                <li>a nested query, enclosed in parentheses "
                    <b>(</b>" "
                    <b>)</b>" (also called query/field
                    <dfn>grouping</dfn>) . Note that this may be used with a +/- prefix to require any of a set of terms. </li>
                <li>boolean
                    <dfn>operators</dfn> which allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Supported are
                    <b>AND</b>(
                    <b>&amp;&amp;</b>), "
                    <b>+</b>",
                    <b>OR</b>(
                    <b>||</b>),
                    <b>NOT</b>(
                    <b>!</b>) and "

            <ul>
                <li>to perform a regular expression search use the "
                    <b>/</b>" enclosure, e.g. /[mb]an/ - will search for man or for ban;
                    <br/> NOTE: path field search escapes "/" by default, so it only supports regexps when the search string
                    <u>starts and ends</u> with "/".
                    <br/> More info can be found on
                    <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/6_6_0/core/org/apache/lucene/util/automaton/RegExp.html?is-external=true">Lucene regexp page</a>.
                </li>
                <li>to perform a single character wildcard search use the "
                    <b>?</b>" symbol, e.g. te?t</li>
                <li>to perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "
                    <b>*</b>" symbol, e.g. test* or te*t</li>
                <li>you can use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search (unless not enabled using indexer option -a).</li>
                <li>to do a fuzzy search (find words similar in spelling, based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance
                    algorithm) use the tilde, "
                    <b>~</b>", e.g. rcs~ </li>
                <li>to do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example to search for a "opengrok"
                    and "help" within 10 words of each other enter: "opengrok help"~10 </li>
                <li>range queries allow one to match documents whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified
                    by the Range Query. Range Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting
                    is done lexicographically. Inclusive queries are denoted by square brackets
                    <b>[ ]</b> , exclusive by curly brackets
                    <b>{ }</b>. For example: title:{Aida TO Carmen} - will find all documents between Aida to Carmen, exclusive
                    of Aida and Carmen. </li>
            </ul>

            <a id="escaping">
                <dfn>Escaping special characters:</dfn>
            </a>
            <p>
                Opengrok supports escaping special characters that are part of the query syntax. Current special characters are:
                <br/>
                <b>+ - &amp;&amp; || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ / </b>
                <br/> To escape these character use the \ before the character. For example to search for
                <b>(1+1):2</b> use the query:
                <b>\(1\+1\)\:2</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE on analyzers: Indexed words are made up of Alpha-Numeric and Underscore characters. One letter words are usually not
                indexed as symbols!
                <br/> Most other characters (including single and double quotes) are treated as "spaces/whitespace" (so even if
                you escape them, they will not be found, since most analyzers ignore them).
                <br/> The exceptions are:
                <b>@ $ % ^ &amp; = ? . :</b> which are mostly indexed as separate words.
                <br/> Because some of them are part of the query syntax, they must be escaped with a reverse slash as noted above.
                <br/> So searching for
                <b>\+1</b> or
                <b>\+ 1</b> will both find
                <b>+1</b> and
                <b>+ 1</b>.

            <h4>Intelligence Window</h4>
            <p>
                Key "1" toggles
                <dfn>Intelligence Window</dfn>. It gives the user many helper actions on the last symbol pointed by the mouse
                cursor.
            </p>
            <img src="/source/default/img/intelli-window.png" />

            <h5>Symbol Highlighting</h5>
            <p>
                Keys "2", "3", "4" toggles highlighting of the last symbol pointed by the mouse cursor. This functionality is also accessible
                via the
                <dfn>Intelligence Window</dfn>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key "5" toggles unhighlighting all symbols. This functionality is also accessible via the
                <dfn>Intelligence Window</dfn>.
            </p>
            <img src="/source/default/img/symbol-highlighting.png" />

            <p>
                You can close the intelligence window either by mouse in the right upper corner or by keyboard with "Esc" key.
            </p>

            <h5>Symbol jumping</h5>
            <p>
                By 'n' for next and 'b' for back you can jump between the symbols easily only with keyboard. When there is no symbol highlighted
                then the jump is made to the next symbol in the file from the current one. If you have highlighted a specific
                symbol then the jump is done only among the highlighted symbols regardless the color of the symbol.
            </p>

            <h4>Diff jumper</h4>

            <p>
                The OpenGrok also provides an easy way how to jump through the large diffs finding the interesting pieces of code. In the
                diff mode you can enable diff jumper by hitting the "jumper" button.
            </p>
            <img src="/source/default/img/diff-jumper.png" />

            <h5>Mouse and keyboard navigation</h5>
            <p>
                You can then use your mouse to intuitively navigate yourself through the diff. Also there is a convenient shortcut for moving
                on your keyboard, you can use 'n' for next and 'b' for back to jump over to the next chunk. This is available
                even when the jumper window is not opened.
